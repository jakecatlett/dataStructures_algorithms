# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains 6 C++ programs I submitted for my Data Structures and Algorithms course at Southern New Hampshire University

The individual programs are clearly marked at the places where my code changes were required.  As the programs increase in 
complexity, a progressively larger portion of each program is based on code produced in earlier labs.  The content/purpose of
each program is listed here:

**Lab1:** Implement a custom data structure.  The structure created is to hold information on bids placed at a car auction.

**Lab2:** Implement a vector to contain a collection of bids.  Load and parse a .csv file to populate the vector.

**Lab3:** Implement a linked list to contain the collection of bids.

**Lab4:** Implement select sort and quick sort.  Execute them both and analyze results to determine more efficient algorithm.

**Lab5:** Implement a hash table.  Implement the logic to search for, modify, and print out instances in the hash table.

**Lab6:** Implement a binary search tree.  Implement the logic to modify and search through the binary search tree.

I was required to write an analysis of the different algorithms we had implemented, and when and how they are appropriate.
This has been included in the repo as well.
